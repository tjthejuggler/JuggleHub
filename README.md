# JuggleHub - Advanced Juggling Analysis System

A high-performance monorepo combining C++ real-time ball tracking with Python-based analysis and visualization.

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-22 19:26:00 UTC

## üéØ Overview

JuggleHub is a complete system for the real-time analysis and interactive control of juggling patterns. It is built on a high-performance, hybrid architecture that separates low-latency C++ processing from high-level Python management.

### Core Philosophy

This project is guided by a few key principles:

-   **Real-Time First:** For interactive applications (games, coaching feedback, ball control), logic that must run *per-frame* belongs in the C++ engine to guarantee the lowest possible latency.
-   **Python for Flexibility:** The Python hub is the "mission control" for the system. It is used for configuration, data logging, visualization, and running any analysis that is not strictly real-time.
-   **API-Driven:** The C++ engine and Python hub communicate through a strict, versioned API defined with Protocol Buffers. This is the single source of truth for all data structures, preventing integration errors.
-   **Modularity over Monolith:** The C++ engine is not a single application, but a host for pluggable, real-time "Modules". This allows new interactive applications to be developed in C++ without ever modifying the core tracking code.

### Building with Debug Info

To build the engine with debug symbols and verbose output:
```bash
./scripts/build_engine.sh --debug --verbose
```

### Workflow: Creating a New Real-Time Module

Here is the step-by-step process for adding a new interactive feature (e.g., a new game that colors the balls based on their height).

1.  **(API) Define Data Structures:** If your new module needs to send or receive unique data, add the new message types to [`api/v1/juggler.proto`](api/v1/juggler.proto:1).

2.  **(C++) Create the Module:**
    -   Create a new file in [`engine/src/modules/`](engine/src/modules/:1), for example, `HeightColorModule.cpp`.
    -   In this file, create a class that inherits from the `ModuleBase` interface.
    -   Implement the `setup()`, `update()`, and `cleanup()` methods. The `update()` function will contain your real-time logic that runs every frame.

3.  **(C++) Register the Module:**
    -   Open [`engine/src/Engine.cpp`](engine/src/Engine.cpp:1) (or a dedicated module factory file).
    -   Include the header for your new module.
    -   Add your new module to the list of available modules so the engine knows it exists and can be loaded.

4.  **(Build) Recompile the Engine:** Run `./scripts/build_engine.sh`. This will compile your new module and also regenerate the Protobuf files for both C++ and Python, ensuring everything is in sync.

5.  **(Python) Add Control Logic:**
    -   In the Python [`hub/`](hub/:1), modify the UI or application logic to send a ZMQ command to the C++ engine to load your new module. For example: `send_command({"command": "LOAD_MODULE", "name": "HeightColorModule"})`.

6.  **Run and Test!**

### Running Tests

```bash
# Verify Protocol Buffer definitions compile for Python
make generate-proto

# Run Python unit tests
cd hub && python3 -m pytest

# Test the hub components
cd hub
python3 -m pytest
```

### Adding New Features

1. **Modify the API**: Update [`api/v1/juggler.proto`](api/v1/juggler.proto:1)
2. **Rebuild**: Run build scripts to regenerate Protocol Buffer files
3. **Update Engine**: Modify C++ code in [`engine/src/`](engine/src/:1)
4. **Update Hub**: Modify Python code in [`hub/components/`](hub/components/:1)

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Future Vision

This architecture provides a foundation for many advanced features:

-   **[ ] Advanced Coaching Modules**: Implement C++ modules for pattern analysis, consistency scoring, and real-time feedback.
-   **[ ] Wearable Sensor Integration**: Add support for IMU data from wearables (gloves, watches) to the Protobuf API and fuse it with vision data in the engine.
-   **[ ] Web Interface**: Create a web-based dashboard using the Python hub as a backend to view juggling sessions from any device.
-   **[ ] FPGA/Hardware Acceleration**: Explore offloading parts of the vision pipeline (like color thresholding) to hardware like a Xilinx Kria for even lower latency.
-   **[ ] ROS Integration**: Add a ROS 2 compatibility layer to allow the engine to publish data as standard ROS topics.

## üìà Performance

### Typical Performance Metrics
- **Engine**: 60-90 FPS at 848x480, 30-60 FPS at 1280x720
- **Hub**: Real-time processing with <10ms latency
- **Memory**: ~100MB engine, ~50MB hub
- **CPU**: 15-25% on modern quad-core systems

### Optimization Tips
- Use `--high-fps` for maximum frame rate
- Reduce resolution for better performance
- Use `--downscale 0.5` for processing optimization
- Enable hardware acceleration where available

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No RealSense device found"**
- Ensure camera is connected to USB 3.0 port
- Check RealSense SDK installation
- Try different USB ports

**"Protocol Buffer files not found"**
- Run `./scripts/build_engine.sh` to generate files
- Check that `protoc` is installed and in PATH

**"ZMQ connection failed"**
- Ensure engine is running first
- Check firewall settings
- Verify endpoint addresses match

**Low frame rate**
- Close other camera applications
- Use lower resolution settings
- Check USB bandwidth limitations

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for detailed information:

```bash
# Engine debug (via stderr)
./engine/build/bin/juggle_engine 2>engine_debug.log

# Hub debug
./scripts/run_hub.sh --debug
```
